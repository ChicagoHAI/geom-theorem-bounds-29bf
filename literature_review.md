# Literature Review

## Background

The mathematical foundations for automated theorem discovery and pattern mining span several key areas. Building on Johansson's work (2015), automated theorem proving requires formal logic systems with well-defined inference rules and heuristic search strategies. The framework typically employs first-order logic with equality, utilizing specialized data structures for pattern matching and unification. Kovács et al. (2024) established crucial geometric completion algorithms that leverage algebraic methods for automated discovery of geometric properties and relations.

The theoretical underpinnings include computational complexity theory for evaluating algorithm efficiency, as explored by Gabidullina & Doostmohammadian (2025) in their work on distributed optimization. The mathematics of pattern mining, as demonstrated by Wang et al. (2020), relies heavily on lattice theory and probabilistic bounds for utility measures. Goodship et al. (2025) provided rigorous stability analysis for numerical methods, particularly in the context of Runge-Kutta schemes, establishing theoretical bounds for error propagation and computational efficiency.
