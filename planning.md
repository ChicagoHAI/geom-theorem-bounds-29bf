## Main Claim

For any geometric theorem discovery system G using first-order logic with equality, there exists a complexity threshold function T(n) = O(n^3 log n) such that if the computational resources allocated exceed T(n), the probability of discovering a novel theorem of statement length n approaches 1 - e^(-n) asymptotically

## Supporting Lemmas

1. Lemma 1: The search space of well-formed geometric statements of length n has cardinality bounded above by 2^(n log n)
2. Lemma 2: For any geometric statement s of length n, the verification complexity using algebraic methods is bounded by O(n^2)
3. Lemma 3: The probability of generating a syntactically valid geometric statement using guided heuristic search is at least c/n for some constant c > 0
4. Lemma 4: The overlap between discovered theorems and known results in any finite axiom system decreases exponentially with statement length n

## Proof Strategy

1) Establish a measure-theoretic framework for the space of geometric statements
2) Prove that heuristic search with algebraic verification creates a martingale sequence
3) Apply the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality to bound deviation probabilities
4) Use the method of moments to show convergence to the claimed asymptotic behavior
5) Demonstrate that the threshold function T(n) is tight via adversarial construction

## Validation Approach

1) Implement the theorem discovery system using GeoGebra's automated reasoning engine
2) Generate and verify 10,000 geometric statements of varying lengths
3) Compare empirical discovery rates with theoretical predictions
4) Measure actual computational resources used versus T(n)
5) Validate exponential decay of overlap with known results using the TPTP problem library
